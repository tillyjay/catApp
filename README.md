# catApp
The application is an interface where the user can select three different cat characteristics and the app will match you with the perfect cat. The site is desktop and mobile friendly.

The app was created using JavaScriptâ€™s fetch function to grab data from an API, sort and filter it with three separate JS array methods to return a selected piece of data. The app also leveraged a jQuery library and was styled entirely using SASS. The elements were also created dynamically with DOM manipulation.

Working with an API was a challenging new experience but was a great exercise in working with data. Additionally, this was my first-time using SASS; a bit of a learning curve, but I now understand why incorporating variables into styling can be super beneficial in writing concise code.
